# User Research Philosophy

We conduct user research sessions to build empathy for our users and to gain insight that will drive feature development. 

# Process

## 1. Proposal

If you see an opportunity where user research would substantially help us develop a product or feature, start by writing a proposal in the Docs database.

## 2. Find Candidate Users

You can find candidates for user research on Intercom. Explain why you chose them.

## 3. Interview Guide

Write an interview guide in our Docs database so that anyone conducting interviews knows how to drive the conversation with users.
